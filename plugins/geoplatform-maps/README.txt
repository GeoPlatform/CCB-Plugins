Create and manage collections of interactive, customized and reusable GeoPlatform.gov Open Map objects for embedding as shortcode links in pages and posts.

== Description ==

The GeoPlatform Maps plugin is used to create and manage customized and reusable instances of Open Map objects for embedding as interactive web map components within your pages and posts. With this plugin you have the ability to easily compile and manage a local collection of interactive maps. With shortcodes generated by this plugin, rich, layered, dynamic maps can be easily embedded into your content. This plugin was made for use within  GeoPlatform themes, but will also work within any themes you wish to use.

The GeoPlatform Maps plugin makes use of Open Map object implementations such as those created, managed, and served from [GeoPlatform.gov](https://www.geoplatform.gov/). Open Map objects are implementation-agnostic, Linked Open Data representations of any web map resource. The GeoPlatform Maps plugin uses the [GeoPlatform Open API] (https://www.geoplatform.gov/geoplatform-help/api/) to link to Open Map objects created, organized, and advertised by the [GeoPlatform Map Manager](https://maps.geoplatform.gov/) application. You can link to any existing Open Map object listed by the GeoPlatform Map Manager application. Feel free to register an user account at [GeoPlatform.gov](https://www.geoplatform.gov/) so you can create your own custom Open Map objects. The GeoPlatform Maps plugin establishes links to Open Map objects using their MapID property.

With the GeoPlatform Maps plugin installed, use the "Settings" page in the Dashboard menu to create shortcode links to Open Map objects hosted on the [GeoPlatform.gov Maps Database](https://maps.geoplatform.gov/). The MapID can be found as part of the URL in the displayed area shown when the "Show Embed" control is selected from the GeoPlatform Map Manager application. Adding maps to your own local collection of Open Map objects is as simple as pasting the MapID of the desired Open Map into the "Input Map ID" text field and then pressing the "Add Map" button. If the specified MapID is valid, a new map  will be added to your local collection! You can also optionally specify height and width values to control the size and shape of the map object to be embedded into you Wordpress page or post.

Each Open Map added using the GeoPlatform Maps plugin generates a shortcode. Just copy this shortcode and paste it within your pages and posts to embed a dynamic, customized, interactive map within your content! The size of the map components is limited to width and height if specified. By default, map components automatically expand to fit the region in which it was inserted.

Map components created with the GeoPlatform Maps plugin give users the ability to view, pan and zoom through an interactive map, view and toggle the visibility of individual layers, and view  more detailed information about the map and its layers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed the plugin, where can I get maps? =

The GeoPlatform Maps plugin creates dynamic links to Open Map objects created and managed using the [GeoPlatform Map Manager](https://maps.geoplatform.gov/) application. To link to an Open Map object, you will need its MapID, the hexidecimal string that can be found in the "embed" information displayed by the Map Manager application.

= Why can't I add a link to an Open Map to my local collection? =

The error response should tell you most of what you need to know. MapIDs have a set format, and must exist and be visible from the GeoPlatform Map Manager application if they are to be added. It is also possible that you tried to add an AGOl map using the map ID in the address bar. Because of the way AGOL maps are handled, this will not function properly.

= My map is a static thumbnail image with no layer controls! What is happening? =

Currently, the GeoPlatform Maps plugin does not parse ArcGIS Online (AGOL) implementations of Open Map objects, so a static image of the AGOL map is all that is displayed. More dynamic support for AGOL maps is a feature that may come in a future update of the Maps plugin. Of course you can always click on the Map component embedded in your page or post to launch the AGOL Map Viewer application in a new browser tab or window.

= I have an interactive map, but where are my layer options? =

The GeoPlatform Maps Plugin will not show the layer menu if the map is too small. If you have a custom width or height value set for your map, try increasing them. If the layer menu is still not visible, try switching to a different theme.

= I added my map to the shortcode collection, but I'm getting an error when I view it in a post! =

If you were able to successfully add a map to your shortcode collection but not to your post or page, it is most likely due to an error incorporating the shortcode. Take another look at the shortcode and copy it over again if need be.

== Screenshots ==

1. Import maps from the [GeoPlatform Map Manager](https://maps.geoplatform.gov/) and build your own map library for your community.
2. Use the shortcode generated by the GeoPlatform Maps plugin to insert maps into your posts.
3. Enjoy full pan and zoom control over your maps, toggle layers, view layer details, and launch the map in a separate application in your browser.
