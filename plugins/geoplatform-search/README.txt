Utilize a dedicated interface to browse, search, and filter GeoPlatform service objects.

== Description ==

The GeoPlatform Search plugin is used to provide the user with an easy, intuitive means by which to browse, search, and filter GeoPlatform service objects directly within their site. Simple in design, the plugin generates a dedicated interface which hosts all of the tools needed. Additionally, it provides the ability via shortcode to access that interface via a non-intrusive search bar placecd wherever you like.

With the GeoPlatform Search plugin installed, simple activation will create a new page on your site titled "GeoPlatform Search." This new page acts as a dedicated, full-sized interface for the search application. It gives you full access to the entire library of GeoPlatform assets. From here, you can browse the results, sort them by an array of different criteria, and filter them using a wide array of different criteria:

* Keyword search
* Community
* Creator
* Geographic extent
* Points of contact
* Publishers
* Semantic concepts
* Temporal extent
* Themes
* Types

On the administrative side, the GeoPlatform Search plugin is incredibly simple. In the unlikely event that the search page become corrupted or otherwise unusable, a button here will regenerate the page. Additionally, another button provides a direct link to the search page.

Another feature of this plugin is the ability to embed search bars into your pages and posts that interact with the interface. Through the simple inclusion of the shortcode found in the settings page anywhere on your site, any user can use the evoked search bar to perform a filtering operation on the search page's interface, navigating to it in the process.
