Browse, search, and access the portfolio of GeoPlatform.gov assets.

== Description ==

The GeoPlatform Search plugin is used to browse, search, and access the portfolio of GeoPlatform assets (Datasets, Services, Layers, Maps, Galleries, Communities) by users throughout the GeoPlatform ecosystem. The plugin presents for users an application interface to the GeoPlatform search engine via the GeoPlatform Open API. Additionally, the plugin integrates searching for and accessing local content (pages, posts, documents) found on the site.

The plugin can be used to embed search bars into your pages and posts for searching the GeoPlatform portfolio. Just generate and include a shortcode found in the settings page to integrate a search bar anywhere.

With the GeoPlatform Search plugin installed, activation will create a new page on your site called "GeoPlatform Search." This new page acts as a dedicated search application, with full-sized UI, providing full access to the entire portfolio of GeoPlatform assets.

Using the GeoPlatform Search plugin, you can browse the entire portfolio of GeoPlatform assets using a wide array of criteria (below) and standard search functionality such as paging and sorting:

* Free text search
* Keyword search
* Community association
* Asset Creator
* Geographic extent
* Points of contact
* Publishers
* Semantic concepts
* Temporal extent
* Themes
* Asset Types

The GeoPlatform Search plugin provides a simple administrative interface, supplying admin users the ability to regenerate the page should the need arise. It also provides a direct link to the search page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed the plugin, how do I access the search page? =

Upon activation, the plugin creates a dedicate search page on your site with the title “GeoPlatform Search.” There are multiple ways to access it: the plugin’s settings provides a direct link to page, and you can also insert a shortcode into another page or post that directs users to it. And, of course, it can be found under the page listing in the admin dashboard.

= My search page got corrupted, how do I fix it? =

It is unlikely that the page would be corrupted, but in case it has, the plugin’s settings can regenerate the page with a press of the Recreate Search Interface button.

= How can I make the page easily accessible to my readers? =

The Search plugin provides shortcode support that will work anywhere on your site where text is input. When inserting a shortcode, you embed a search bar into your post that accepts search criteria and navigates directly to the search page.

= Do the same constraints apply to both GeoPlatform Assets (“Portfolio”) results as well as “Site Content” results? =

In a limited fashion, yes.  Free-text and creator constraints apply to both types of results, but mostly the available constraints apply only to GeoPlatform Assets.

== Screenshots ==

1. Enjoy a vibrant and feature-rich browsing environment of GeoPlatform assets.
2. Use shortcode to place search bar access to the Search application anywhere in your site.
